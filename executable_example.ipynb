This data can be generated using the [data_generation_ppi.ipynb](https://github.com/DeepRank/deeprank2/blob/main/tutorials/data_generation_ppi.ipynb) tutorial or downloaded from Zenodo at [this record address](https://zenodo.org/record/8349335).

For doing so, `train` and `dataset_train` parameters are used. When `train` is set as `False`, a `dataset_train` of the same class must be provided and it will be used to scale the validation/testing sets according to its features values. You need to pass `features_transform` to the training dataset only, since in other cases it will be ignored and only the one of `dataset_train` will be considered. \n",
