# somef-demo-repo
This repo aims to provide values for each metadata field that SOMEF (v0.9.4) can extract.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my fellow maSMP-Hackathonners for the great vibes and Leyla Jael Castro for organizing it.

# Application Domain
This repo hopes to contribute to a vision of an extension of the existing World Wide Web, which provides software programs with machine-interpretable metadata of the published information and data.
